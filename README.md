# cSharp-.NET--Unity---VR-World-Building

I am a fledgling Unity and C# programmer, i came to c# after javascript, sql, node, and python. I dont just make games or anything like that, i Build entire worlds / metaverses. i host them on places like marquette, vrchat, and altspace to name a few. People come and hang out in the worlds i build. Ive put on performances with my instruments in them. Ive sat next to people who are on the other side of the planet in them. Its definately the way the future is heading and im getting in on the ground floor of it.
